							<h2>Portfolio</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This portfolio showcases six of my python data projects that I have pinned for easy access.
							Each project represents a distinct data problem that I have solved through the use of various data science techniques such as data wrangling and machine learning.
							You can find more by clicking on the Github link to access my repository.

								<h3>Mushroom Supervised Classification Project (part of IBM ML certification)</h3>
								<p></p>The Mushroom Supervised Classification Project was part of the IBM ML certification program. The aim was to use supervised classification models to determine if mushrooms were poisonous. The data was sourced from Kaggle and explored using EDA techniques. Sklearn's LabelEncoder was used to encode categorical data and a test-train split was performed. Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier models were used.<p></p>

								<h3>Bjj classification and Extraction</h3>
								<p></p> The project aims to automate the analysis of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu data and make predictions using supervised classification models.
								Data was webscraped from a reputable source for Bjj, and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn were used for data frame creation, manipulation, and machine learning models.
								The notebook works by taking user inputs to scrape fighter data, clean it, and analyze it using machine learning models, with potential for further optimization

								<h3>IBM Course Recommendation system</h3>
								<p>The project aims to build a course recommender system using various machine learning models.
									Both supervised and unsupervised models were used and compared with each other.
									The machine learning models used include dot product, Bag of Words, clustering, PCA, KNN, NMF, and a Tensorflow neural network classifier with embeddings.</p>

								<h3>Pyspark Basics</h3>
								<p>This notebook covers PySpark Basics including its architecture, installation, setup and configuration
									It then discusses SQL Data Wrangling with PySpark, including reading and writing data from/to various sources, filtering, joining, grouping, and aggregating data
									Finally, the notebook discusses machine learning with PySpark, covering topics such as feature engineering, model training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment.</p>

								<h3>Reddit NLP analysis</h3>
								<p>This is a Python script that extracts data from the Reddit API, performs data cleaning and analysis using NLP techniques, and performs sentiment analysis on the text.
									The purpose of the project is to analyze the sentiment of posts related to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and identify the most frequently mentioned people and topics.
									The project also includes the development of a dashboard that links to the output csv and images.</p>

								<header>
								<h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
								<p>The project aimed to use Deep Learning (specifically autoencoding) to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or not.
									The dataset used was considerably large with 284,807 rows and 31 columns, and was imbalanced with only 492 fraud transactions out of the total.
									Various normalization methods and hyperparameters for the autoencoder were tested in conjunction with three supervised classification models, resulting in the top three models having an accuracy of 0.99, 0.96, and 0.96.</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Hi, my name is Ikram and I'm a data science professional with a strong passion for machine learning.
								Despite being someone with ADHD, I pride myself on my adaptability and ability to navigate the neurotypical world.</p>
							<p>I have an MSc in Space Engineering from the University of Surrey and a BEng in Aerospace Engineering from Brunel University. During my Master's thesis, I taught myself Python while exploring spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry with real satellite data, leading me to the fundamentals of machine learning.
								I have experience as a Graduate Data Engineering consultant and as a data engineering and data science consultant. I earned a Machine Learning certificate in EDA, supervised and unsupervised learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning in my free time on weekends.
								I continue to develop my skills in data science and machine learning.</p>
							<p>In my spare time I train as a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner at 10th Planet London.</p>
